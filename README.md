# About
Anonymous chat (and calling?) to connect to a volunteer network for discussion on personal/professional problems.

# What grinds your gears?
Do you ever have a problem that you would like to discuss but not with someone you know who might judge you after? Do you sometimes feel that there are not enough people who just want to see the world thrive?  Well…step right up, share your problems anonymously and we’ll help sort things out. It could be anything personal, professional, related to family, friends, workplace, technology, mental well-being, physical fitness…you name it!  So just sign up, go into anonymous mode and start sharing!  Oh, and if you’d like to help other, by all means, do that. If you want to be part of our volunteer network to regularly help out folks in real life as well, please send a message to @srmrox.
